If you want to connect to Kinetic on mainnet without running your own Kinetic server, then Kinetic As A Service is the way forward.

To use Kinetic As A Service, you'll want to sign up with a Kinetic As A Service Provider.

When you sign-up to a Kinetic As A Service provider, you'll need to go through their setup process.

If your app is going to transact with Kin and you want to earn via the [KRE](/docs/essentials/kin-rewards-engine), you'll need to give them your App Index, so make sure you've registered.

### More to come!

We'll let you know here as more Kinetic As A Service providers become available.

## How To Connect

Once you've chosen a KAAS provider, connecting to Kinetic is incredibly simple.

Just, instantiate your Kinetic Client via your SDK of choice with the `endpoint` set to the endpoint provided by your Kinetic As A Service provider.

E.g. using the [TypeScript SDK](/docs/developers/typescript)

```js
const clientOptions = {
  environment: 'mainnet', // mainnet or devnet
  index: 1, // your App Index
  endpoint: 'kinetic_as_a_service_endpoint', // get this from your KAAS provider
}

const kineticClient = await KineticSdk.setup(clientOptions)
```

## Kinetic Manager

Your KAAS provider should also be able to give you access to Kinetic Manager, a fantastic GUI you can use to configure your application, view transactions and more.

Check out some of the key features below:

**Note:** Access to Kinetic Manager and the exact settings available will depend on what's being offered by your KAAS Provider.
