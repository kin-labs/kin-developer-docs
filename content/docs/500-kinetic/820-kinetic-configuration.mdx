Kinetic is highly configurable, giving you a huge amount of power in how you manage your Kinetic instance.

Kinetic configuration is split between settings you control via Environment Variables, as well as those you can change in Kinetic itself with the Kinetic Manager.

## Kinetic Manager

Kinetic Manager is a powerful tool for managing, maintaining and observing the performance of your Kinetic instance.

Check out some of the key features below:

### Set Your RPC Provider

A Solana RPC provider is required for Kinetic to be able to access data on the Solana blockchain.

Solana provides free api endpoints for this, e.g. for `devnet`:

```
https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

These free endpoints are rate limited, so depending on your use-case, you may want to upgrade to a paid service.

Learn more about Solana RPC Providers [here](https://docs.metaplex.com/resources/rpc-providers).

### Provision, View And Manage Your Apps

Note - You can add apps via your [Environment Variables](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-hosting#prepare-your-environment-variables) as well.

### View Your Transactions

See a filterable list of all your transactions in one place or drill down into an individual transaction to see how long each step in the process has taken.

### View Your App Hot-Wallet Status

Check your app hot-wallet balances, mints and more.

### Configure Your App Settings

#### Mints

Add multiple mints to your Kinetic instance.

#### Access Control

Define who / how your Kinetic instance is accessed.

#### Webhooks

Configure your app webhooks so you can view events, verify transactions, get an automated warning if your hot-wallet balance falls below a threshold, etc.

##### Balance Webhook

The balance webhook allows you to receive an alert when your app's hotwallet is running low on Sol so you can top it up and ensure your app can continue to keep transacting.

E.g. In a node express server:

```js
app.use('/balance', async (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body
  // DO STUFF WITH THE BALANCE ALERT
  res.sendStatus(200)
})
```

##### Event Webhook

The event webhook allows you to receive alerts when actions have been confirmed on the Solana blockchain.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-event.png)

E.g. In a node express server:

```js
app.use('/events', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body
  // DO STUFF WITH THE EVENT DATA
  res.sendStatus(200)
})
```

##### Verify Webhook

The verify webhook allows you to have fine-grained control over transactions, making sure they meet your own criteria before allowing them to proceed.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-event.png)

E.g. In a node express server return a `200` status code to approve the transaction or a `400` to reject it:

```js
app.use('/verify', async (req, res) => {
  const transaction = req.body
  // CHECK THAT YOU WANT THIS TRANSACTION TO PROCEED
  // e.g.
  if (transaction.amount < 1000000) {
    res.sendStatus(200)
  }
  res.sendStatus(400)
})
```

### Configure Your Global Kinetic Settings

Use the admin dashboard to view your apps, see your Solana clusters, see and configure your Kinetic users and more.

## Kinetic Environment Variables

See the full list of environment variables for Kinetic <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/main/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.<br/>
To see the options required for a minmal setup, have a look at <a href='https://github.com/kin-starters/kinetic-docker-compose/blob/main/docker-compose.yml' target='_blank'>this</a>.

Here are some things to be aware of:

### Provisioning Apps

- Provision an app via Environment Variables with your registered App Index. E.g. if your App Index is `360`: `APP_360_NAME`, `APP_360_FEE_PAYER_BYTE_ARRAY` and the optional `APP_360_LOGO_URL` can be set to ensure your app shows up correctly in Kinetic Manager
- You can also provision apps using Kinetic Manager, in that case, the app data is stored in your database. Using Environment Variables for app provision may make it easier to provision apps quickly from scratch.

### Setting Your Auth Method

- For Kinetic instances in production, we strongly recommend turning off password based authentication and using one of the supported SSO methods:

#### GitHub Login

- Get a GitHub oAuth client ID and secret from `https://github.com/settings/developers` or `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/applications`
- Set the callback URL to `<your API_URL>/auth/github/callback`
- Set your environment variables:

```
  AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED: "false"
  AUTH_USERS: "githubusername||Admin|githubemail@address"
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: "d9fa784f2c711zzzzz"
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET: "a2e42904c81280c1466d95de040c516zzzzzzzz"
  GITHUB_ENABLED: "true"
```

#### Discord Login

- Get a Discord oAuth client ID and secret from `https://discord.com/developers/applications`
- Set the callback URL to `<your API_URL>/auth/discord/callback`
- Set your environment variables:

```
  AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED: "false"
  AUTH_USERS: "discordusername||Admin|discordemail@address"
  DISCORD_CLIENT_ID: "d9fa784f2c711zzzzz"
  DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET: "a2e42904c81280c1466d95de040c516zzzzzzzz"
  DISCORD_ENABLED: "true"
```

#### Google Login

- Get a Google oAuth client ID and secret from `https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in`
- Set the callback URL to `<your API_URL>/auth/google/callback`
- Set your environment variables:

```
  AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED: "false"
  AUTH_USERS: "googleusername||Admin|googleemail@address"
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "d9fa784f2c711zzzzz"
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: "a2e42904c81280c1466d95de040c516zzzzzzzz"
  GOOGLE_ENABLED: "true"
```
