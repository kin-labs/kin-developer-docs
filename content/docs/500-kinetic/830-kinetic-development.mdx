Get a great understanding of the services that work together to make Kinetic.

Have a tinker or contribute to the project.

Kinetic is open source so all are welcome!

## Requirements

This is what you'll need to run Kinetic on your own machine.

```shell
Node.js 14+
Docker 20+
Yarn v1.22+
```

## Get Started

To get started with Kinetic, pull down the Kinetic repo and install dependencies.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kin-labs/kinetic.git
cd kinetic
yarn install
```

## Prepare Your Local Environment Variables

Kinetic is highly configurable, but don't worry, we've provided an example file you can use to get started quickly.<br/>
Just copy the contents of the `.env.example` file into your own `.env` file.<br/>

See here for more details on Kinetic Environment Variables:

  />

## Run Docker

  />
</div>

## Run Kinetic Services

Then, in separate terminals, do each of the following:

- run the database

```shell
yarn dev:services:postgres
```

- prepare the database

```shell
yarn prisma migrate reset && yarn prisma db push
```

- run Solana locally (`localhost:8899`) or set `SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC_ENDPOINT=devnet` and skip this step

```shell
yarn dev:services:solana
```

- run the Kinetic API (`localhost:3000`)

```shell
yarn dev:api
```

- run the Kinetic Demo App (`localhost:4200`) : Optional

```shell
yarn dev:demo
```

- run the Kinetic Manager (`localhost:4400`)

```shell
yarn dev:admin
```

## Open The Kinetic Demo

- Use the built-in Kinetic Demo to test Kin transactions on your Kinetic instance
- [Click here](http://localhost:4200) to open localhost:4200

## Open The Kinetic Manager

- Kinetic Manager is a full-featured GUI for Kinetic
- You can log in using the details set in your `.env` file.
- [Click here](http://localhost:4400) to open localhost:4400
