Here we'll explain how you can deploy your own Kinetic instance to an online service such as [Render](https://www.render.com) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

You can also deploy directly onto a server using [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), etc. Check out our [starter apps](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-hosting#demos-and-starter-kits) below if you want to get going quickly and know your way around a server.

## Sign Up To A Hosting Service

You'll need somewhere to run your Kinetic instance on the cloud.

  />
</div>

## Create A New App

Create a new app using your preferred service and connect it to the Kinetic repo.

```

## Set Up A PostrgreSQL Server

You'll need a database to run Kinetic. See how to setup and connect to your DB here:

- [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/new/database) allows you to set up a separate PostreSQL server.
- [Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) allows you to install a PostrgeSQL db directly into a project as an addon.

## Set Up A Redis Server

You'll need a database to run Kinetic. See how to setup and connect to your DB here:

- [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/new/redis) allows you to set up a separate Redis server.
- [Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis) allows you to install a Redis db directly into a project as an addon.

## Prepare Your Environment Variables

Kinetic handles some of it's configuration via environment variables.

    link={{ url: '/docs/kinetic/kinetic-configuration#kinetic-environment-variables', label: 'Set your tings...' }}
  />
</div>

## Deploy Kinetic

Once your environment is prepared, you're ready to deploy! Fingers crossed!

Make sure to check out the logs in case something goes wrong.

If something does go wrong and you can't figure it out, never fear!

## Get Started With Kinetic Manager

That's it! You should be good to go. Open your app and log in via the method you specified in your environment variables.

You're now using Kinetic Manager!

<KineticManager />

## Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose can be used to run multiple containers in a single Docker application. An example of this is our Kinetic Docker Compose starter below.

If you are using Docker Compose with your deployed server, you may need to install an additional `Compose` Plugin.

See [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for details.

## Demos and Starter Kits

Created to help get you up and running as quickly as possible, these projects can be a great reference point when you get stuck or even a starter for your own project. Happy coding!
