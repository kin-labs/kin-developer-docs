Here we'll show you how you can deploy your own Kinetic instance to an online service such as [Render](https://www.render.com) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

You can also deploy directly onto a server using [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), etc.

## What Do I Need To Run Kinetic?

To run an instance of Kinetic, you'll need to have 3 services set up and running:

- Kinetic
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- [Solana RPC Provider](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-configuration#set-your-rpc-provider)

If that seems complicated, don't worry! It couldn't be easier. To get you going, we've created some lovely starter kits!

## Starter Kits

Created to help get you up and running as quickly as possible, these projects can be a great reference point when you get stuck or even a starter for your own project. Happy coding!

## Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose can be used to run multiple containers in a single Docker application. An example of this is our Kinetic Docker Compose starter.

If you are using Docker Compose with your deployed server, you may need to install an additional `Compose` Plugin.

See [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for details.

## Environment Variables

Kinetic handles some of it's configuration via environment variables you can include as you set up your deployment. See more here:

## Kinetic Manager

Once you've deployed Kinetic, you'll be able to access Kinetic Manager to handle further configuration and app settings, etc

<KineticManager />
