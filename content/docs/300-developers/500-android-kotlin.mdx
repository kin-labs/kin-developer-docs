## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with Kin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your app.

### Installation

In your root build.gradle or settings.gradle, make sure you've included jitpack:
```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
And add the dependency, normally in the module-level build.gradle:
```
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.kin-labs:kinetic-android-sdk:1.0.0-rc.5'
}
```

### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

The Kinetic SDK uses Kotlin suspend functions to perform asynchronous network calls. We recommend calling these from within a CoroutineScope as follows where necessary. As there are many ways to handle asynchronous code in Kotlin, we will not include the CoroutineScope in every piece of sample code, but it may be necessary in your implementation.

```kotlin
import org.kin.kinetic.KineticSdk

CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
	val kinetic = KineticSdk.setup(  
	    "https://sandbox.kinetic.host",
	    "devnet",
	    1
	)
}
```

Don't have an App Index? Register your app on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

### Create Account

You can create accounts from existing mnemonics or secret keys. In this case we'll generate a mnemonic and use that to create the keypair we use for creating the account on the blockchain.

```kotlin
val owner = Keypair.random()
val transaction = kinetic.createAccount(owner)
```

### Check Balance

```kotlin
val balance = kinetic.getBalance(owner.publicKey).balance
```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

```kotlin
val airdropSignature = kinetic.requestAirdrop(owner.publicKey).signature
```

### Transfer Kin

```kotlin
val txSignature = kinetic.makeTransfer(
	"5000",
	"BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo",
	owner
).signature
```

### Get Transaction Details

```kotlin
val transactionDetails = kinetic.getTransaction(txSignature)
```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```kotlin
val explorerURL = kinetic.getExplorerUrl("account or transaction id string")
```

### Get Account History

```kotlin
val accountHistory = kinetic.getHistory(owner.publicKey)
```


## Demos and Starter Kits

Created to help get you up and running as quickly as possible, these projects can be a great reference point when you get stuck or even a starter for your own project. Happy coding!

## Upgrading to Kinetic from Agora?

<Agora />

Here, we will outline the key API changes from the old version of our SDK to the new Kinetic version.

**General notes**

- For methods that request Kin be transferred, `amount` is the amount of Kin, not quarks.
- Response objects from requests have updated / changed.

**Instantiate the Kin Client**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
import org.kin.kinetic.KineticSdk

CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
	val kinetic = KineticSdk.setup(  
	    "https://sandbox.kinetic.host",
	    "devnet",
	    1
	)
}

// Agora
import org.kin.sdk.base.*

val environment: KinEnvironment = KinEnvironment.Agora.Builder(NetworkEnvironment.DevNet)
        .setAppInfoProvider(object : AppInfoProvider {  
            override val appInfo: AppInfo =  
                AppInfo(  
                    AppIdx(1),  
                    KinAccount.Id("public key"),  
                    "App Name",  
                    R.mipmap.appIcon  
                )  
  
            override fun getPassthroughAppUserCredentials(): AppUserCreds {  
                return AppUserCreds("demo_app_uid", "demo_app_user_passkey")  
            }  
        })  
        .build()

```

**Create Account**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
val owner = Keypair.random()
val transaction = kinetic.createAccount(owner)

// Agora
val accountContext = KinAccountContext.Builder(environment)  
    .createNewAccount()  
    .build()
```

**Check Balance**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
val balance = kinetic.getBalance(owner.publicKey).balance

// Agora
val balanceObserver = accountContext.observeBalance(ObservationMode.Active)  
balanceObserver.add { kinBalance: KinBalance ->  
    val balance = kinBalance.amount.value.toInt()  
}
```

**Transfer Kin**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
val txSignature = kinetic.makeTransfer(
	"5000",
	"BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo",
	owner,  
	type = KinBinaryMemo.TransactionType.Spend
).signature

// Agora
accountContext.sendKinPayment(
	KinAmount(5000),
	KinAccount.Id("BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo"),
	memo
)  
    .then(  
        onResolved = { kinPayment ->  
            val txSignature = Base58.encode(kinPayment.id.transactionHash.rawValue) 
        },  
        onRejected = { t ->  
            // Handle error 
        }  
    )
```
