## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with Kin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your app.

### Installation

In your root build.gradle or settings.gradle, make sure you've included jitpack:

```
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

And add the dependency, normally in the module-level build.gradle:

```
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.kin-labs:kinetic-android-sdk:1.0.0-rc.5'
}
```

**If you're using proguard to minify your release app, add these lines to your proguard-rules.pro**
```
-keep class org.kin.kinetic.**{*;}
-keep class org.kin.kinetic.**$* {*;}
-keep class com.solana.**{*;}

-keep class org.bitcoinj.**{*;}
-keep class org.bitcoin.**{*;}
```


### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

The Kinetic SDK uses Kotlin suspend functions to perform asynchronous network calls. We recommend calling these from within a CoroutineScope as follows where necessary. As there are many ways to handle asynchronous code in Kotlin, we will not include the CoroutineScope in every piece of sample code, but it may be necessary in your implementation.

```kotlin
import org.kin.kinetic.KineticSdk

CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
	val kinetic = KineticSdk.setup(
	    "https://sandbox.kinetic.host",
	    "devnet",
	    1
	)
}
```

Don't have an App Index? Register your app on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

While you're waiting for confirmation of your App Index, use `1` on devnet so you can get started.

### Create Account

You can create accounts randomly or from existing mnemonics or secret keys. Below, we'll make a keypair and use that for creating an account on the blockchain.

You can also generate keypairs and create accounts on devnet via the [Kin Laboratory](https://laboratory.kin.org/keypairs).

```kotlin
val owner = Keypair.random()
val transaction = kinetic.createAccount(owner)
```

### Close Account

It's good practice to close unneeded accounts. You can only close accounts that you have created and are currently empty.

```kotlin
val transaction = kinetic.closeAccount(owner.publicKey)
```

### Check Balance

Check a user balance by passing in the public key of the account you want to check.

The response object includes your total Kin balance as well as detailing all of the Mints and Tokens held by that Public Key.

```kotlin
val balance = kinetic.getBalance(owner.publicKey).balance
```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

Send some test funds to a specific Public Key on Devnet.

Or visit the [Kin Laboratory](https://laboratory.kin.org/airdrop) to do it with a click!

```kotlin
val airdropSignature = kinetic.requestAirdrop(owner.publicKey).signature
```

### Transfer Kin

Transfer Kin from a Keypair to any Public Key.

Make sure to include your Transaction Type if you want it to count towards the KRE.

```kotlin
val txSignature = kinetic.makeTransfer(
	"5000",
	"BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo",
	owner
).signature
```

### Get Transaction Details

Get the details of any transaction by passing in the transaction signature.

```kotlin
val transactionDetails = kinetic.getTransaction(txSignature)
```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```kotlin
val explorerURL = kinetic.getExplorerUrl("account or transaction id string")
```

### Get Account History

Get the full transaction history of any account by passing in the account's Public Key.

```kotlin
val accountHistory = kinetic.getHistory(owner.publicKey)
```

### Get Account Info

Easily get the main info of any account by passing in the account's Public Key.

```kotlin
val accountInfo = kinetic.getAccountInfo(owner.publicKey)
```

### Get Token Accounts

Get the full list of [Token Accounts](/docs/essentials/terms-and-concepts#token-account) held by a Keypair on Solana.

```kotlin
val tokenAccounts = kinetic.getTokenAccounts(owner.publicKey)
```

## Demos and Starter Kits

Created to help get you up and running as quickly as possible, these projects can be a great reference point when you get stuck or even a starter for your own project. Happy coding!

## Developer Best Practices

Once you're ready to code, have a quick look at our [Developer Best Practices](/essentials/best-practices/) where we cover some useful topics that you'll want to keep in mind as you build out your Kin application.

<BestPractices />

## Upgrading to Kinetic from Agora?

<Agora migrate />

Here, we will outline the key API changes from the old version of our SDK to the new Kinetic version.

**General notes**

- For methods that request Kin be transferred, `amount` is the amount of Kin, not quarks.
- Response objects from requests have updated / changed.

**Instantiate the Kin Client**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
import org.kin.kinetic.KineticSdk

CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO).launch {
	val kinetic = KineticSdk.setup(
	    "https://sandbox.kinetic.host",
	    "devnet",
	    1
	)
}

// Agora
import org.kin.sdk.base.*

val environment: KinEnvironment = KinEnvironment.Agora.Builder(NetworkEnvironment.DevNet)
        .setAppInfoProvider(object : AppInfoProvider {
            override val appInfo: AppInfo =
                AppInfo(
                    AppIdx(1),
                    KinAccount.Id("public key"),
                    "App Name",
                    R.mipmap.appIcon
                )

            override fun getPassthroughAppUserCredentials(): AppUserCreds {
                return AppUserCreds("demo_app_uid", "demo_app_user_passkey")
            }
        })
        .build()

```

**Create Account**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
val owner = Keypair.random()
val transaction = kinetic.createAccount(owner)

// Agora
val accountContext = KinAccountContext.Builder(environment)
    .createNewAccount()
    .build()
```

**Check Balance**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
val balance = kinetic.getBalance(owner.publicKey).balance

// Agora
val balanceObserver = accountContext.observeBalance(ObservationMode.Active)
balanceObserver.add { kinBalance: KinBalance ->
    val balance = kinBalance.amount.value.toInt()
}
```

**Transfer Kin**

```kotlin
// Kinetic
val txSignature = kinetic.makeTransfer(
	"5000",
	"BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo",
	owner,
	type = KinBinaryMemo.TransactionType.Spend
).signature

// Agora
accountContext.sendKinPayment(
	KinAmount(5000),
	KinAccount.Id("BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo"),
	memo
)
    .then(
        onResolved = { kinPayment ->
            val txSignature = Base58.encode(kinPayment.id.transactionHash.rawValue)
        },
        onRejected = { t ->
            // Handle error
        }
    )
```
