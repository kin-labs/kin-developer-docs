Kinetic is highly configurable, giving you a huge amount of power in how you manage your Kinetic instance.

Kinetic configuration is split between settings you control via Environment Variables, as well as those you can change in Kinetic itself with the Kinetic Manager.

## Kinetic Environment Variables

See the full list of environment variables for Kinetic <a href='https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic/blob/main/.env.example' target='_blank'>here</a>.

Here are some things to be aware of:

### Provisioning Apps

- Provision an app via Environment Variables with your registered App Index. E.g. if your App Index is `360`: `APP_360_NAME`, `APP_360_FEE_PAYER_BYTE_ARRAY` and the optional `APP_360_LOGO_URL` can be set to ensure your app shows up correctly in Kinetic Manager
- You can also provision apps using Kinetic Manager, in that case, the app data is stored in your database. Using Environment Variables for app provision may make it easier to provision apps quickly from scratch.

### Setting Your Auth Method

- For Kinetic instances in production, we strongly recommend turning off password based authentication and using one of the supported SSO methods:

#### GitHub Login

- Get a GitHub oAuth client ID and secret from `https://github.com/settings/developers` or `https://github.com/organizations/<your-org>/settings/applications`
- Set the callback URL to `<your API_URL>/auth/github/callback`
- Set your environment variables:

```
  AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED: "false"
  AUTH_USERS: "githubusername||Admin|githubemail@address"
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: "d9fa784f2c711zzzzz"
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET: "a2e42904c81280c1466d95de040c516zzzzzzzz"
  GITHUB_ENABLED: "true"
```

#### Discord Login

- Get a Discord oAuth client ID and secret from `https://discord.com/developers/applications`
- Set the callback URL to `<your API_URL>/auth/discord/callback`
- Set your environment variables:

```
  AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED: "false"
  AUTH_USERS: "discordusername||Admin|discordemail@address"
  DISCORD_CLIENT_ID: "d9fa784f2c711zzzzz"
  DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET: "a2e42904c81280c1466d95de040c516zzzzzzzz"
  DISCORD_ENABLED: "true"
```

#### Google Login

- Get a Google oAuth client ID and secret from `https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in`
- Set the callback URL to `<your API_URL>/auth/google/callback`
- Set your environment variables:

```
  AUTH_PASSWORD_ENABLED: "false"
  AUTH_USERS: "googleusername||Admin|googleemail@address"
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: "d9fa784f2c711zzzzz"
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: "a2e42904c81280c1466d95de040c516zzzzzzzz"
  GOOGLE_ENABLED: "true"
```

### Some Things To Watch Out For

- `COOKIE_DOMAINS` must contain your deployed domain for your version of Kinetic, e.g. `my-kinetic-instance.onrender.com`.
- Any url that contains `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` should be changed to `0.0.0.0` or whatever domain you have deployed to.
- On Heroku, make sure not to include quote marks around your strings as Heroku won't filter them out.<br/>

## Kinetic Manager

Kinetic Manager is a powerful tool for managing, maintaining and observing the performance of your Kinetic instance.

Check out some of the key features below:

### Provision, View And Manage Your Apps

### View Your Transactions

See a filterable list of all your transactions in one place or drill down into an individual transaction to see how long each step in the process has taken.
