## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with Kin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your app.

### Installation

```shell
pip install kinetic-sdk
```

### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

```python
from kinetic_sdk import KineticSdk

kinetic_client = KineticSdk.setup(
    environment='devnet', # the name of your environment, e.g. devnet, mainnet,
    index=1, # your App Index
    endpoint='https://sandbox.kinetic.host', # devnet endpoint
)
```

Don't have an App Index? Register your app on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

While you're waiting for confirmation of your App Index, use `1` on devnet so you can get started.

### Create Account

You can create accounts randomly or from existing mnemonics or secret keys. Below, we'll make a keypair and use that for creating an account on the blockchain.

You can also generate keypairs and create accounts on devnet via the [Kin Laboratory](https://laboratory.kin.org/keypairs).

```python
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment
from kinetic_sdk.keypair import Keypair

mnemonic = Keypair.generate_mnemonic()
keypair = Keypair.from_secret(mnemonic)

# or keypair = Keypair.random()

kinetic_client.create_account(
    owner=keypair,
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
)
```

### Close Account

It's good practice to close unneeded accounts. You can only close accounts that you have created and are currently empty.

```python
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment

kinetic_client.close_account(
    account=keypair.public_key,
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
)
```

### Check Balance

Check a user balance by passing in the public key of the account you want to check.

The response object includes your total Kin balance as well as detailing all of the Mints and Tokens held by that Public Key.

```python
balance = kinetic_client.get_balance(account=keypair.public_key)
```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

Send some test funds to a specific Public Key on Devnet.

Or visit the [Kin Laboratory](https://laboratory.kin.org/airdrop) to do it with a click!

```python
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment

airdrop = kinetic_client.request_airdrop(
    account=keypair.public_key,
    amount='1000',
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
)
```

### Transfer Kin

Transfer Kin from a Keypair to any Public Key.

Make sure to include your Transaction Type if you want it to count towards the KRE.

```python
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment
from kinetic_sdk.models.transaction_type import TransactionType

transfer = kinetic_client.make_transfer(
    amount='5000',
    destination='BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo',
    owner=keypair,
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
    tx_type=TransactionType.P2P, # Optional, can be Unknown, None, Earn, Spend or P2P
    reference='some reference', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    sender_create=False # Optional, will make a Kin Token Account at that destination if true
)
```

Note - `reference` is stored off chain and will be passed back to the app via webhooks if they are set up.

### Transfer Kin Batch

Make a batch transfer of Kin.

```python
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment

destinations = []

destinations.append(
  {
    'amount': '500',
    'destiation': 'BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA123'
  })
destinations.append(
  {
    'amount': '600',
    'destiation': 'BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA456'
  })
destinations.append(
  {
    'amount': '700',
    'destiation': 'BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA789'
  })

batch_transfer = kinetic_client.make_transfer_batch(
    owner=keypair,
    destinations=destinations,
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
    reference_id='some id', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    reference_type='some reference', # Optional, stored off-chain, returned via webhooks
    sender_create=False # Optional, will make a Kin Token Account at that destination
)
```

### Get Transaction Details

Get the details of any transaction by passing in the transaction signature.

```python
transaction = kinetic_client.get_transaction(signature='transaction id string')
```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```python
explorer_url = kinetic_client.get_explorer_url('transaction id string')
```

### Get Account History

Get the full transaction history of any account by passing in the account's Public Key.

```python
history = kinetic_client.get_history(account=keypair.publicKey)
```

### Get Account Info

Easily get the main info of any account by passing in the account's Public Key.

```python
account_info = kinetic_client.get_account_info(account=keypair.publicKey)
```

### Get Token Accounts

Get the full list of [Token Accounts](/docs/essentials/terms-and-concepts#token-account) held by a Keypair on Solana.

```python
token_accounts = kinetic_client.get_token_accounts(account=keypair.publicKey)
```

### Webhooks

Whether you are using [Kinetic As A Service](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-as-a-service) or [Self-Hosting](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-hosting) to connect to Kinetic, once you're up and running, you'll be able to access [Kinetic Manager](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-configuration#kinetic-manager) to manage your app's settings.

This includes allowing you to configure your app to use a number of webhooks.

#### Balance Webhook

The balance webhook allows you to receive an alert when your app's hotwallet is running low on Sol so you can top it up and ensure your app can continue to keep transacting.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-balance.png)

E.g. In a python server:

```python
@cross_origin()
@app.route('/balance', methods=['POST'])
def events():
    print('request_body: ', request.body)
    # DO STUFF WITH BALANCE ALERT
    response = '', 200
    return response
```

#### Event Webhook

The event webhook allows you to receive alerts when actions have been confirmed on the Solana blockchain.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-event.png)

E.g. In a python server:

```python
@cross_origin()
@app.route('/events', methods=['POST'])
def events():
    print('request_body: ', request.body)
    # DO STUFF WITH EVENT DATA
    response = '', 200
    return response
```

#### Verify Webhook

The verify webhook allows you to have fine-grained control over transactions, making sure they meet your own criteria before allowing them to proceed.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-event.png)

E.g. In a python server return a `200` status code to approve the transaction or a `400` to reject it:

```python
@cross_origin()
@app.route('/verify', methods=['POST'])
def events():
    print('request_body: ', request.body)
    # CHECK THAT YOU WANT THIS TRANSACTION TO PROCEED
    # Return 200 if you do
    response = '', 200
    return response
```

## Developer Best Practices

Once you're ready to code, have a quick look at our [Developer Best Practices](/essentials/best-practices/) where we cover some useful topics that you'll want to keep in mind as you build out your Kin application.

<BestPractices />

## Upgrading to Kinetic from Agora?

<Agora migrate />

Here, we will outline the key API changes from the old version of our SDK to the new Kinetic version.

**General notes**

- For methods that request Kin be transferred, `amount` is the amount of Kin, not quarks.
- Response objects from requests have updated / changed.

**Instantiate the Kin Client**

```python
# Kinetic
from kinetic_sdk import KineticSdk

kinetic_client = KineticSdk.setup(
    environment='devnet', # the name of your environment, e.g. devnet, mainnet,
    index=1, # your App Index
    endpoint='https://sandbox.kinetic.host', # devnet endpoint
)

# Agora
from agora.client import Client, Environment
env = Environment.TEST
app_index = 1
kin_client = Client(env, app_index)
```

**Create Account**

```python
# Kinetic
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment
from kinetic_sdk.keypair import Keypair

mnemonic = Keypair.generate_mnemonic()
keypair = Keypair.from_secret(mnemonic) # or Keypair.random()

account = kinetic_client.create_account(
    owner=keypair,
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
)

# Agora
from agora.keys import PrivateKey

private_key = PrivateKey.random()
account = kin_client.create_account(private_key)
```

**Check Balance**

```python
# Kinetic
balance = kinetic_client.get_balance(account=keypair.public_key)

# Agora
balance = kin_client.get_balance(public_key)
```

**Airdrop Funds (devnet)**

```python
# Kinetic
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment

airdrop = kinetic_client.request_airdrop(
    account=keypair.public_key,
    amount='1000',
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
)

# Agora
from agora.utils import kin_to_quarks

token_account='kin token account for that keypair'
amount = '1000'
quarks = kin_to_quarks(amount)
airdrop = kin_client.request_airdrop(token_account, quarks)
```

**Transfer Kin**

```python
# Kinetic
from kinetic_sdk import Commitment
from kinetic_sdk.models.transaction_type import TransactionType

transfer = kinetic_client.make_transfer(
    amount='5000',
    destination='BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo',
    owner=keypair,
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
    tx_type=TransactionType.P2P, # Optional, can be Unknown, None, Earn, Spend or P2P
    reference_id='some id', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    reference_type='some reference', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    sender_create=False # Optional, will make a Kin Token Account at that destination if true
)

# Agora
from agora.model import Payment, TransactionType
from agora.utils import kin_to_quarks


sender = some_private_key
destination = some_public_key
transaction_type = TransactionType.P2P

amount = '1000'
quarks = kin_to_quarks(amount)

payment = Payment(sender, destination, transaction_type, quarks)

transfer = kin_client.submit_payment(payment)

# The Agora invoice option has been replaced by 'reference'
```

**Transfer Kin Batch**

```python
# Kinetic
from kinetic_sdk import Destination, Commitment

destinations = []

destinations.append(
  {
    'amount': '500',
    'destiation': 'BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA123'
  })
destinations.append(
  {
    'amount': '600',
    'destiation': 'BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA456'
  })
destinations.append(
  {
    'amount': '700',
    'destiation': 'BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA789'
  })

batch_transfer = kinetic_client.make_transfer_batch(
    owner=keypair,
    destinations=destinations,
    commitment=Commitment('Finalized'), # Optional: "Confirmed", "Finalized", "Processed"
    reference_id='some id', # Optional, stored off-chain and returned via webhooks
    reference_type='some reference', # Optional, stored off-chain, returned via webhooks
    sender_create=False # Optional, will make a Kin Token Account at that destination
)

# Agora
from agora.model import Payment, TransactionType, Earn, EarnBatch

earns = []
earns.append(
  Earn('BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA123', kin_to_quarks('500'))
)
earns.append(
  Earn('BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA456', kin_to_quarks('600'))
)
earns.append(
  Earn('BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MA789', kin_to_quarks('700'))
)

sender = some_private_key
batch = EarnBatch(sender, earns)

batch_transfer = kin_client.submit_earn_batch(earns)

```

**Get Transaction Details**

```python
# Kinetic
transaction = kinetic_client.get_transaction(signature='transaction id string')

# Agora
import base58

decoded = base58.b58decode('transaction_id')
transaction = kin_client.get_transaction(decoded)
```

**Webhooks**

In Agora, we used the `sign_transaction` webhook. That's been deprecated and we now have the `verify` webhook that can simply return a 200 status code to confirm verification of a request.
