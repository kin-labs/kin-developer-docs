## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with Kin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your app.

### Installation

**Using Swift Package Manager**

- In Xcode: File > Add Packages...
- Search "[https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic-ios-sdk](https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic-ios-sdk)"
- Choose appropriate Dependency Rule for your needs
- Add Package

### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

```swift
import Kinetic

let kinetic = await KineticSdk.setup(
	endpoint: "https://sandbox.kinetic.host",
	environment: "devnet",
	index: 1
)
```

Don't have an App Index? Register your app on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

While you're waiting for confirmation of your App Index, use `1` on devnet so you can get started.

### Create Account

You can create accounts randomly or from existing mnemonics or secret keys. Below, we'll make a keypair and use that for creating an account on the blockchain.

```swift
let owner = Keypair.random()
let transaction = await kinetic.createAccount(owner: owner)
```

### Check Balance

Check a user balance by passing in the public key of the account you want to check.

The response object includes your total Kin balance as well as detailing all of the Mints and Tokens held by that Public Key.

```swift
let balance = await kinetic.getBalance(account: owner.publicKey).balance
```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

Send some test funds to a specific Public Key on Devnet.

```swift
let airdropSignature = await kinetic.requestAirdrop(account: owner.publicKey).signature
```

### Transfer Kin

Transfer Kin from a Keypair to any Public Key.

```swift
let txSignature = await kinetic.makeTransfer(
	amount: "5000",
	destination: "BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo",
	owner: owner
).signature
```

### Get Transaction Details

Get the details of any transaction by passing in the transaction signature.

```swift
let transactionDetails = await kinetic.getTransaction(signature: txSignature)
```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```swift
let explorerURL = kinetic.getExplorerUrl(path: "account or transaction id string")
```

### Get Account History

Get the full transaction history of any account by passing in the account's Public Key.

```swift
let accountHistory = kinetic.getHistory(account: owner.publicKey)
```

### Get Token Accounts

Get the full list of [Token Accounts](/docs/essentials/terms-and-concepts#token-account) held by a Keypair on Solana.

```swift
let tokenAccounts = kinetic.getTokenAccounts(account: owner.publicKey)
```

Note on Token Accounts with Kinetic. You should never need to send Kin directly to a particular token account. All transfers should go to the Keypair's publicKey.


## Demos and Starter Kits

Created to help get you up and running as quickly as possible, these projects can be a great reference point when you get stuck or even a starter for your own project. Happy coding!

## Developer Best Practices

Once you're ready to code, have a quick look at our [Developer Best Practices](/essentials/best-practices/) where we cover some useful topics that you'll want to keep in mind as you build out your Kin application.

<BestPractices />

## Upgrading to Kinetic from Agora?

<Agora migrate />

Here, we will outline the key API changes from the old version of our SDK to the new Kinetic version.

**General notes**

- For methods that request Kin be transferred, `amount` is the amount of Kin, not quarks.
- Response objects from requests have updated / changed.

**Instantiate the Kin Client**

```swift
// Kinetic
import Kinetic

let kinetic = await KineticSdk.setup(
	endpoint: "https://sandbox.kinetic.host",
	environment: "devnet",
	index: 1
)

// Agora
import KinBase

let appInfoProvider = BasicAppInfoProvider(...)
let env = KinEnvironment.Agora.mainNet(appInfoProvider: appInfoProvider)
let kinAccountContext = KinAccountContext.Builder(env: env).createNewAccount().build()

```

**Create Account**

```swift
// Kinetic
let owner = Keypair.random()
let transaction = await kinetic.createAccount(owner: owner)

// Agora
let kinAccountContext = KinAccountContext.Builder(env: env).createNewAccount().build()
```

**Check Balance**

```swift
// Kinetic
let balance = await kinetic.getBalance(account: owner.publicKey).balance

// Agora
let balanceObserver = kinAccountContext.observeBalance(mode: .active)
balanceObserver.subscribe({ (kinBalance) in
	let balance = (kinBalance.amount as NSNumber).intValue
})
```

**Transfer Kin**

```swift
// Kinetic
let txSignature = await kinetic.makeTransfer(
	amount: "5000",
	destination: "BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo",
	owner: owner,
    type: KineticKinMemo.TransactionType.spend
).signature

// Agora
kinAccountContext.sendKinPayment(
	KinPaymentItem(
		amount: Kin(5000),
		destAccount: PublicKey(base58: "BQJi5K2s4SDDbed1ArpXjb6n7yVUfM34ym9a179MAqVo")!
	),
	memo: KinBinaryMemo(
		typeId: KinBinaryMemo.TransferType.spend.rawValue,
		appIdx: 1
	).kinMemo
).then { payment in
	let txSignature = payment.id.transactionHash.base58
}
.catch({ error in
	// Handle error
})
```
