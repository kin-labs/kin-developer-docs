## Get Started or Add to an Existing Project

Getting started with Kin is incredibly straightforward. Just follow the steps below to start transacting with Kin in your app.

### Installation

```shell

```

### Instantiate the Kinetic Client

The Kinetic Client will give you access to all the methods you need to work with Kin on the blockchain.

We recommend starting with Devnet before moving on to Mainnet.

```

```

Don't have an App Index? Register your app on our Developer Portal so you can get your App Index that allows you to transact with our SDKs and earn via the KRE.

<RegisterApp />

While you're waiting for confirmation of your App Index, use `1` on devnet so you can get started.

### Create Account

You can create accounts randomly or from existing mnemonics or secret keys. Below, we'll make a keypair and use that for creating an account on the blockchain.

You can also generate keypairs and create accounts on devnet via the [Kin Laboratory](https://laboratory.kin.org/keypairs).

```

```

### Close Account

It's good practice to close unneeded accounts. You can only close accounts that you have created and are currently empty.

```

```

### Check Balance

Check a user balance by passing in the public key of the account you want to check.

The response object includes your total Kin balance as well as detailing all of the Mints and Tokens held by that Public Key.

```

```

### Airdrop Funds (devnet)

Send some test funds to a specific Public Key on Devnet.

Or visit the [Kin Laboratory](https://laboratory.kin.org/airdrop) to do it with a click!

```

```

### Transfer Kin

Transfer Kin from a Keypair to any Public Key.

Make sure to include your Transaction Type if you want it to count towards the KRE.

```

```

### Transfer Kin Batch

Make a batch transfer of Kin.

```

```

### Get Transaction Details

Get the details of any transaction by passing in the transaction signature.

```

```

### Get Solana Explorer URL

[Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/)

```

```

### Get Account History

Get the full transaction history of any account by passing in the account's Public Key.

```

```

### Get Account Info

Easily get the main info of any account by passing in the account's Public Key.

```

```

### Get Token Accounts

Get the full list of [Token Accounts](/docs/essentials/terms-and-concepts#token-account) held by a Keypair on Solana.

```

```

### Webhooks

Whether you are using [Kinetic As A Service](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-as-a-service) or [Self-Hosting](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-hosting) to connect to Kinetic, once you're up and running, you'll be able to access [Kinetic Manager](/docs/kinetic/kinetic-configuration#kinetic-manager) to manage your app's settings.

This includes allowing you to configure your app to use a number of webhooks.

#### Balance Webhook

The balance webhook allows you to receive an alert when your app's hotwallet is running low on Sol so you can top it up and ensure your app can continue to keep transacting.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-balance.png)

E.g. In a node express server:

```js
app.use('/balance', async (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body
  // DO STUFF WITH THE BALANCE ALERT
  res.sendStatus(200)
})
```

#### Event Webhook

The event webhook allows you to receive alerts when actions have been confirmed on the Solana blockchain.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-event.png)

E.g. In a node express server:

```js
app.use('/events', async (req, res) => {
  const event = req.body
  // DO STUFF WITH THE EVENT DATA
  res.sendStatus(200)
})
```

#### Verify Webhook

The verify webhook allows you to have fine-grained control over transactions, making sure they meet your own criteria before allowing them to proceed.

![Balance Webhook](/images/kinetic-manager/webhook-event.png)

E.g. In a node express server return a `200` status code to approve the transaction or a `400` to reject it:

```js
app.use('/verify', async (req, res) => {
  const transaction = req.body
  // CHECK THAT YOU WANT THIS TRANSACTION TO PROCEED
  // e.g.
  if (transaction.amount < 1000000) {
    res.sendStatus(200)
  }
  res.sendStatus(400)
})
```

## Demos and Starter Kits

Created to help get you up and running as quickly as possible, these projects can be a great reference point when you get stuck or even a starter for your own project. Happy coding!

## Developer Best Practices

Once you're ready to code, have a quick look at our [Developer Best Practices](/essentials/best-practices/) where we cover some useful topics that you'll want to keep in mind as you build out your Kin application.

<BestPractices />

## Upgrading to Kinetic from Agora?

<Agora migrate />

Here, we will outline the key API changes from the old version of our SDK to the new Kinetic version.

**General notes**

- For methods that request Kin be transferred, `amount` is the amount of Kin, not quarks.
- Response objects from requests have updated / changed.

**Instantiate the Kin Client**

```js
// Kinetic
import { KineticSdk } from '@kin-kinetic/sdk'
const kinClient = await KineticSdk.setup({ environment, index })

// Agora
import { Client } from '@kinecosystem/kin-sdk-v2'
const kinClient = new Client(env, { appIndex })
```

**Create Account**

```js
// Kinetic
await kinClient.createAccount({ owner: keypair })

// Agora
await kinClient.createAccount(privateKey)
```

**Check Balance**

```js
// Kinetic
const { balance } = await kinClient.getBalance({ account })

// Agora
const balance = await kinClient.getBalance(publicKey)
```

**Airdrop Funds (devnet)**

```js
// Kinetic
await kinClient.requestAirdrop({ account, amount })

// Agora
await kinClient.requestAirdrop(tokenAccountPublicKey, quarks)
```

**Transfer Kin**

```js
// Kinetic
await kinClient.makeTransfer({ amount, destination, owner, type })

// Agora
await kinClient.submitPayment({ quarks, destination, sender, type })
```

**Transfer Kin Batch**

```js
// Kinetic
const destinations = [{ destination, amount }]
await kinClient.makeTransferBatch({ owner, destinations })

// Agora
const earns = [{ destination, quarks }]
await kinClient.submitEarnBatch({ sender, earns })
```

**Get Transaction Details**

```js
// Kinetic
// Coming Soon

// Agora
import bs58 from 'bs58'
const transactionBuffer = bs58.decode(transactionId)
const data = await kineticClient.getTransaction(transactionBuffer)
```

**Webhooks**

In Agora, we used the `sign_transaction` webhook. That's been deprecated and we now have the `verify` webhook that can simply return a 200 status code to confirm verification of a request.
